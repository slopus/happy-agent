# `@slopus/happy-agent-client`

A typed client for the Happy agent HTTP API, specified endpoint by endpoint in
`packages/happy-agent/API.md`.

`HappyAgentClient` is built from an endpoint and a bearer token. It has one typed method per
request-response route, and it opens the event journal both as pulled pages and as a typed
async iterator over the live Server-Sent Events stream, cancelled with an `AbortSignal`. It
keeps no state: caching, version reconciliation, optimistic mutations, retries, and
reconnection are decisions for whatever builds a live view on top of it.

It is built on plain Web APIs — `fetch`, streams, `AbortController`, standard timers — so the
same build runs unchanged in Node and in a browser. The daemon listens on a Unix domain
socket; a caller reaching one supplies its own runtime's socket-capable `fetch`, and the
client never dials a socket itself or reads credentials from disk.

`applyMessageDelta` implements the protocol's offset-aware text reduction without adding client
state: exact and overlapping replays converge idempotently, while a gap or conflicting overlap
returns `reconcile` so the caller can replace the message from authoritative history.

Protocol shapes live in `sources/protocol/`, one file per API chapter, with shared wire
values declared as TypeBox schemas and their TypeScript types derived with `Static`.

Tool calls expose the complete `ToolPresentation` discriminated union — exploration, command,
background-terminal interaction, file diff, and web/X search — together with an exported TypeBox
schema for each variant and `toolPresentationSchema` for the whole set.

Focused agent responses and agent bootstrap include the current module-contributed slash-command
catalog. `invokeSlashCommand` executes one through its owning module, while
`agent.slash_commands.updated` carries complete catalog replacements discovered at turn time.

# Cloud

`CloudModule` is Happy Agent's local Happy Cloud token broker. It owns the WorkOS public-client
PKCE flow, stores the rotating refresh token in the owner-only main database, verifies every minted
access token through Happy Cloud's `/v0/hello`, and publishes token-free versioned status snapshots.

Cloud is independent from `HappyModule`, which connects the daemon to the Happy mobile app.
